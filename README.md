# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We analysed data from a ride sharing business in New York to determine if the same kind of business would be profitable in Des Moines.

## Results
We created seven visualizations to help us determine the profitability of a ride sharing business.

The first thing we wnted to know was the gender of people who used the bikes. We made a pie chart showing us the numbers of riders per gender; male, female, and unknown.

Based on the pie chart it looks like males are about three times as likely to use a bike as females.

The length of time bikes are checked out for is also a good thing to know. Are people more likely to rent them for a shorter or longer amount of time?

The line graph tells us that between 0 and 3 hours, it looks like more people are riding longer and not as many are going for quick bike rides.

Looking at the same line graph we filtered the results to show trip duration by gender.

In the pie chart males are more likely to check out a bike and based on the line graph they are more likely to be checked out longer as well.

Number of bike trips per week per hour can tell us which days are more likely for bikes to be checked out and at what hours as well.

Monday through Friday from 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm have high numbers of bikes checked out. Wednesday, bikes are only being checked out in the morning and Saturday and Sunday bikes are mostly being checked out 10am to 7pm. 

When we break up the previous graph into the different genders the patterns are the same but the number of bike riders per gender changes.

There are more males than female and unknown who checkout bikes as our previous graphs have showed us before.

If we take the previous graph and add a filter for customers and subscribers, which one would have the most bikes checked out?
"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79720084/121822825-d491fd80-cc66-11eb-9863-f4387d0c5f1c.png"
Within the customers, there is no gender that checks out bikes more than the other and the times per weekday are pretty uniform. Withing the subscribers, males definitely have more bikes checked out followed by females. We can also see that Wednesday is a low point for the number of people ching out bikes.

Because some bikes are being used more often and longer than others, those bikes are going to need repairs. With this map we can see the bike ID and how many times it has been riden to prioritize repairs and determine which bikes need them.

As the map shows, the more times a bike is riden the more likely it is to need a repair.

## Summary
Ultimitely there is a higher concentration of male riders using bike sharing that also have longer trip durations. The more a bike is ridden the more likely it is to need a repair and the analyses of number of bikes riden during which times and days of the week can help determine the times and days best utilized for repairing them. Based on these analyses weekdays would be a good day to repair between the hours of 1am and 4am.
